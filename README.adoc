= gRPC streaming on knative

This repository contains a small sample that shows current shortcomings with
gRPC support knative serving, more precisely issue https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/3188[#3188].

== Building
You need `make`, `docker`, `kubectl` and `go 1.11+` installed to build and use this sample.

Assuming you have access to a knative environment, with knative serving later than this
https://github.com/knative/serving/commit/d92cc73ba14ba7f7ffad30256b77891914dc40be[commit]:

```
export IMAGE=gcr.io/<yourproject>/<name>  # or <yourdockerid>/<name> etc...
make deploy # Builds the image and creates a knative service
```

Obtain the IP of your knative cluster and, assuming the default `.example.com` domain mapping, run the client like so:
```
make client
./client [cluster-address] repeater.default.example.com 0
```

This shows that responses don't come through.

Contrast with this running the server locally:

```
make run-server-local
./client localhost:8080 localhost:8080 0   # in a different terminal session
```


Running on knative, if the response messages are big enough, they come through immediately: force a padding of 4096
bytes and witness correct behavior similar to local example:
```
./client [cluster-address] repeater.default.example.com 4096
```
